This is the URL shortener for the IV4t project.


USAGE
-----

Submit a POST request to index.php that looks like this:

Array
(
    [origin] => This originates from the RetakeThe.net project I'd Vote for This
    [uuid] => bacb73fb-247a-4d11-8588-64a279f99c75
)

The Origin string serves as a confirmation that the request has come from a 'legitimate' source
The uuid string us the UUID we want to insert into the database.

index.php will return the URL for the shortlink

http://{host}/ufb0

{host} is the host where the miniURLS are being served from

There is a test setup at http://iv4t.birks.co.nz (pending DNS propagation)
and a test submission available at http://iv4t.birks.co.nz/test.php that offers a sample submission to the database.

Direct Page Submission
----------------------

If you invoke a GET pair of 'original=yes' (e.g. http://iv4t.birks.co.nz/index.php?original=yes)
You will be presented with the original URL shordener's submission so that you can insert any 
given URL into the database.

Database Password
-----------------

The database password in included in an INI file that is parsed in conf.php, 
but is not included in the GIT repo - it's excluded by .gitignore
